Note: You must link/copy these files to the corresponding pywikipedia directory, I
am open to suggestions as to how to do this without linking.

This requires the pyWikipedia bot framework, you can pull from them at:
http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/pywikipedia/trunk/pywikipedia

You can use the git-svn tool to pull from them if you don't want to use svn.

This requires the pyWikipedia bot framework. This bot looks through a page, 
and checks for links, if a link is found it searches for the link on wikibooks, 
if it's not found there it looks on wikipedia, then finally if nothing is 
found there, it removes the link, this is fairly site specific, and then very 
user specific.
